# My-Portfolio
## Message
Hi! If you are here looking for my portfolio of my own codes (Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc.) they are private for now. If you would like to see the code please let me know. When I graduate in May 2025 at UMGC, I will briefly make these codes in public for future job applicaitons. For now, pelase feel free to contact me to see the codes privately in a separate link. Thank you!
