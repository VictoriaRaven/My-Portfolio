# My-Portfolio
## Message
Hi! If you are here looking for my most of my portfolio of (Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc.) they are private for now. If you would like to see the code please let me know. There is a few pulbic repositories I made so feel free to check them out at my home page. When I graduate in May 2025 at UMGC, I will briefly make most of these codes in public for future job applicaitons and then close it after completed. For now, please feel free to contact me to see the codes privately in a separate link. Thank you!
