# My-Portfolio
Hi! If you are here looking for my portfolio of my own codes you should message me at my email or message me on Github here.
The codes that I have done are Java, C++, HTML, and other technology projects. In the future I will do Python.
I put my coding in private repository to prevent anyone to steal my code and work.
If you would like to see it message me or email me.
