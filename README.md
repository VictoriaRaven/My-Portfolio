## Team & Group Contributions
GitHub Contributions (including CMSC Capstone): [My GitHub Contributions](https://github.com/stars/VictoriaRaven/lists/my-contributions-teamwork)

## About Me
### Languages
- French (LEVELS - Speaking:Beginner/Conversational; Reading/Writing/Comprehension:Intermediate Low and Medium; Working On: Intermediate High and Advanced)
- Russian (LEVELS - Speaking:Beginner/Conversational; Reading/Writing/Comprehension:Beginner/Conversational; Working On: Beginner and Intermediate (Low-High))
- Spanish (After the first two above; Currently Only at Intro/Beginner/Conversational level for all parts)
- Others like Italian/Ukrainian, etc. (After I get extremely fluent at the ones above)
### Personality & Work Ethic
- I like fast paced environments, working independently, or as a team (teamwork/dependently), and making postive impacts to the company's goals/ethos or communities.
- I love learning different cultures and continuing to explore more about CS by keeping up-to-date, using Git, and curiosity.
- I believe that CS can be integrated into many different subjects!
- On my free time I like to go outdoors, explore fashion, workout, read, code, play games, learning different cultures, language learning, NATO/EU/Forgien Policies, and Law/Criminal Justice hybrids with CS.
- Most people I know consider me as devoted, loyal, direct communicator, abitious, confident, leader/teacher, analytical, shrewd, protective, and a great team player.
- I learned to adjust and get used to both types of communications (indirect and direct) during my previous experiences, but prefer to use direct communication as that is the "real" me.
- To mitigate this, I have enhanced my communication skills through my minor in Law for Business and taking free online side courses on how to deal with these types of communicators.
- My goal (if positioned as a leader) is to not only being direct, but also teaching others, being a good listener, adjusting to other commmunicaiton styles like constructive feedback rather than blaming someone, and make teamwork sucessful, (taking time to teach my team).
- I love to help others and bring a postive impact to my work and experinces to show that I care for my team.
  - I want each of my members to not only be a part of the team, but also to grow their skills and traits no matter what level they are at (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced)
    - Communication theory states: Direct communication involves explicit and straightforward expression, while Indirect communication relies on nuances, implications, passive agressiveness, and nonverbal cues.
