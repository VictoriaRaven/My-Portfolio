## Message
Hi there! All of my **Public Repositories** has my Public Projects/Class. Feel free to check them out at my home page [Home page](https://github.com/VictoriaRaven?tab=repositories). When I graduate in May 2025 at UMGC, I will briefly make my other private codes in public for future job applications and then close it after completed. This is because some of the repositories has an answer key in a few of my old Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc. classes which would be breaching the University/College policies to share the answer keys publicly. However, during the short period, I will briefly open it publicly so you can see what I learned in my class and for the job applications. The ones public ones are not an answer key but my projects that I adjusted using my problem solving skills and the lessons learned in my CS classes (including Math, Physics, LGST, etc). For now, please feel free to contact me to see the other class codes with answer keys privately in a separate link for the other private repositories. Thank you!

- French 
- Russian
- Ukrainian
- Others (After I get extremely fluent in these three)
### Fun Facts and Personality:
- I like fast paced environments, working independently, or as a team (teamwork/dependently), and making postive impacts to the company's goals/ethos or communities.
- I love learning different cultures and continuing to explore more about CS by keeping up-to-date, using Git, and curiosity.
- I believe that CS can be integrated into many different subjects!
- On my free time I like to go outdoors, workout, read, code, play games, learning different cultures, language learning, NATO/EU/Forgien Policies, and Law/Criminal Justice hybrids with CS.
- Most people I know consider me as devoted, loyal, direct communicator, abitious, confident, leader/teacher, analytical, shrewd, protective, and a great team player.
- I learned to adjust and get used to both types of communications (indirect and direct) during my previous experiences, but prefer to use direct communication as that is the "real" me.
- To mitigate this, I have enhanced my communication skills through my minor in Law for Business and taking free online side courses on how to deal with these types of communicators.
- My goal (if positioned as a leader) is to not only being direct, but also teaching others, being a good listener, adjusting to other commmunicaiton styles like constructive feedback rather than blaming someone, and make teamwork sucessful, (taking time to teach my team).
- I love to help others and bring a postive impact to my work and experinces to show that I care for my team.
  - I want each of my members to not only be a part of the team, but also to grow their skills and traits no matter what level they are at (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced)
    - Communication theory states: Direct communication involves explicit and straightforward expression, while Indirect communication relies on nuances, implications, passive agressiveness, and nonverbal cues.
