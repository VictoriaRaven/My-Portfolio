# My-Portfolio
## Message
Hi there! All of my **Public Repositories** has my Public Projects/Class. Feel free to check them out at my home page [Home page](https://github.com/VictoriaRaven?tab=repositories). When I graduate in May 2025 at UMGC, I will briefly make my other private codes in public for future job applications and then close it after completed. This is because some of them has an answer key in a few of my old Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc. classes which is leaning towards breaching the Univerity/College policies to share answer keys publicly. I will briefly open it publicly so you can see what I learned in my class and for the job applications. The ones public are made and adjusted so that it is not an answer key but my projects that I adjusted using my problem solving skills and the lessons learned in my CS classes (including Math, Physics, LGST, etc). For now, please feel free to contact me to see the other class codes with answer keys privately in a separate link for the other private repositories. Thank you!

### Fun Facts and Personality:
- I like fast paced environments, working indpendently/as a team (dependently), and making postive impacts to the company's goals/ethos or communities.
- I love learning different cultures and continuing to explore more about CS by keeping up-to-date, using Git, and curiosity.
- I believe that CS can be integrated into many different subjects!
- On my free time I like to go outdoors, workout, read, code, play games, learning different cultures, language learning, NATO/EU/Forgien Policies, and Law/Criminal Justice hybrids with CS.
- Most people I know consider me as devoted, loyal, direct communicator, abitious, confident, leader/teacher, analytical, shrewd, protective, and a great team player.
- While others may have misunderstood me due to my communication style.
  - I lean more towards direct communication (includes constructive feedbacks professionally), which why others with indirect communication may misinterpret or misunderstood my intentions out of not being used to my directness.
  - To mitigate this, I have enhanced my communication skills through my Minor in Law for Business and taking free online side courses on how to deal with these types of communicators.
  - My goal if positioned as a leader is to not only being direct, but also learning to listen and adjust my directness to other commmunicaiton styles (like professional constructive feedback rather than blaming someone, etc.) and also make teamwork sucessful, including making time to teach my team as well.
