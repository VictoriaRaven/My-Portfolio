# My-Portfolio
## Message
Hi there! All of my **Public Repositories** has my Public Projects/Class. Feel free to check them out at my home page [Home page](https://github.com/VictoriaRaven?tab=repositories). When I graduate in May 2025 at UMGC, I will briefly make my other private codes in public for future job applications and then close it after completed. This is because some of them has an answer key in a few of my old Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc. classes which is leaning towards breaching the Univerity/College policies to share answer keys publicly. I will briefly open it publicly so you can see what I learned in my class and for the job applications. The ones public are made and adjusted so that it is not an answer key but my projects that I adjusted using my problem solving skills and the lessons learned in my CS classes (including Math, Physics, LGST, etc). For now, please feel free to contact me to see the other class codes with answer keys privately in a separate link for the other private repositories. Thank you!

- French 
- Russian
- Ukrainian
- Others (After I get extremely fluent in these three)
### Fun Facts and Personality:
- I like fast paced environments, working independently/as a team (dependently), and making postive impacts to the company's goals/ethos or communities.
- I love learning different cultures and continuing to explore more about CS by keeping up-to-date, using Git, and curiosity.
- I believe that CS can be integrated into many different subjects!
- On my free time I like to go outdoors, workout, read, code, play games, learning different cultures, language learning, NATO/EU/Forgien Policies, and Law/Criminal Justice hybrids with CS.
- Most people I know consider me as devoted, loyal, direct communicator, abitious, confident, leader/teacher, analytical, shrewd, protective, and a great team player.
- While others may have misunderstood me due to my communication style:
  - I lean more towards direct communication (includes constructive feedbacks professionally), which why others with indirect communication may misinterpret or misunderstood my intentions out of not being used to my directness.
  - Others who disagree and think I'm not direct forget that I adapted my tone or words (similar to a chameleon/lyrebirds) to adjust to the indirect communication which is why he/she doesn't notice it or assume I am mocking/copying them when I'm just adjusting to the other style of communicating.
  - In the professional world, I learned that sometimes you have to be indirect/passive agressive to resolve issues (coworkers, leaders, roles, tasks, keeping track of things, etc.) as it would offend them and destroy your chances of working cooperatively if it is direct.
  - To prove this, I watch and analyze these traits when dealing with people on how he/she handles constructive criticism/feedback.
    - This is proven through the Communication Theory Class I took.
    - Communication theory states: Direct communication involves explicit and straightforward expression, while Indirect communication relies on nuances, implications, passive agressiveness, and nonverbal cues.
      - [Direct v. Indirect Examples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/direct-communication)
        - Direct Ex: Letting someone know something ahead of time is an example of direct communication. Direct communication involves conveying information clearly and without ambiguity, and providing advance notice falls under this definition. 
      - [Indirect includes Passive Agressiveness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-passive-aggressive-behavior-2795481)
        - Indirect Ex: Refusing to provide information and waiting until the last minute can be a form of indirect communication, potentially indicating passive-aggressive behavior. This approach is a lack of transparency and can be seen as a way of expressing negative feelings or avoiding direct confrontation.
      - [Direct v. Indirect based on Countries/Cultures: YouTube Video 1](https://youtu.be/CinT95IFWj4?feature=shared)
      - [Direct v. Indirect based on Countries/Cultures: YouTube Video 2](https://youtu.be/ZjwiX6KNAHE?feature=shared&t=229)
  - I learned to adjust and get used to both types of communications (indirect and direct) during my previous experiences, but prefer to use direct as that is the "real" me.
  - To mitigate this, I have enhanced my communication skills through my Minor in Law for Business and taking free online side courses on how to deal with these types of communicators.
  - My goal (if positioned as a leader) is to not only being direct, but also teaching others, learning to listen, and adjust my directness to other commmunicaiton styles (like professional constructive feedback rather than blaming someone, etc.) and also make teamwork sucessful, including making time to teach my team as well.
  - I love to help others and bring a postive impact to my work and experinces.
    - Even though others may not like my style of communicating or how I make time to adjust to their style, I still enjoy working with them and learning how to teach my knowledge to show that I care for my team.
    - I want each of my members to not only be a part of the team, but also to grow their skills and traits no matter what level they are at (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced)
      - This is also one of the cons I deal with because some of my peers that I experienced in the past do not enjoy being taught by others. They prefer to learn it individually or not learn it at all out of disinterest, in which I will stop and let them be if that is what they choose to be. I do not enforce people to change them, but I do my best as a team player and leader to adjust to thier skills to make a team work.
### Overall
- Based on reading this, it demonstrates my compatibility with the company's ethos and traits that they wish for me to be apart of their team. 
- If you are pleased with my communication skills and personality traits that matches with your company, please take a look at my Public Repositories and consider me as a member to be apart of your team!
- Thank you for taking the time to read this post.
- Note: I removed media as it was unrelated to my professional GitHub page and I want to keep this as professional as possible.
